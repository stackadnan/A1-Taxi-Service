This folder should contain local copies of Leaflet and Leaflet.draw files used as a fallback when CDN resources are blocked.

Files expected:
- leaflet.js
- leaflet.css
- leaflet.draw.js
- leaflet.draw.css

Quick install (from project root):
php tools/download_leaflet.php

If your environment blocks external downloads, download these files manually and place them here with the exact names above.
